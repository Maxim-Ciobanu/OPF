<div class="fragment"><pre class="comment">CASEFORMAT    Defines the MATPOWER case file format.
   A MATPOWER case file is an M-file or MAT-file that defines or returns
   a struct named mpc, referred to as a "MATPOWER case struct". The fields
   of this struct are baseMVA, bus, gen, branch, and (optional) gencost. With
   the exception of baseMVA, a scalar, each data variable is a matrix, where
   a row corresponds to a single bus, branch, gen, etc. The format of the
   data is similar to the PTI format described in
       http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca/formats/pti.txt
   except where noted. An item marked with (+) indicates that it is included
   in this data but is not part of the PTI format. An item marked with (-) is
   one that is in the PTI format but is not included here. Those marked with
   (2) were added for version 2 of the case file format. The columns for
   each data matrix are given below.

   MATPOWER Case Version Information:
   There are two versions of the MATPOWER case file format. The current
   version of MATPOWER uses version 2 of the MATPOWER case format
   internally, and includes a 'version' field with a value of '2' to make
   the version explicit. Earlier versions of MATPOWER used the version 1
   case format, which defined the data matrices as individual variables,
   as opposed to fields of a struct. Case files in version 1 format with
   OPF data also included an (unused) 'areas' variable. While the version 1
   format has now been deprecated, it is still be handled automatically by
   LOADCASE and SAVECASE which are able to load and save case files in both
   version 1 and version 2 formats.
